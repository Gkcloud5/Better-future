#### Explanation about it:


##### What is grep?

* `grep` searches the input files for lines containing a match to a given pattern list.
	* When it finds a match in a line, it copies the line to standard output(by default), or whatever other sort of output you have requested with options.

```
grep root /etc/passwd
```
