**Objects are an encapsulation of variable and function into single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes.**

**Class have related function and data**

```
class GK:
    def __init__(self, name, age, work):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.work = work

Gokul =  GK("Gokul", 26, "Sysadmin")

print(Gokul.name)

```

**Object is a data that we gave and get from class
