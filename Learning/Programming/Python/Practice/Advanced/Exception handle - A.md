##### 3 keyword is very important:
1. Try 
2. except
3. finally

 try run a block of code and check it have any error or not, if it's have any error then it will give to except, in except it has some logic it will happen, finally has last step it definitely run.

```
print(x)
c = 2 + 3
print(c)
```
