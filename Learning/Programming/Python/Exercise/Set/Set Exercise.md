#### Things to remember:
* **UNORDERED** -- Items in the set or unordered, unlike lists, it will not maintain the order in which the items are inserted. items will be in a different order each time when we access the set object. there will not be any index value assigned to each item in the set.
* **UNCHANGEABLE** -- Set items must be immutable. we cannot change the set items, we cannot modify the items value. but we can add or remove items of the set.
* **HETROGENEOUS** -- Set can contains data of all types
* **UNIQUE** -- There cannot be two items with the same value in the set
