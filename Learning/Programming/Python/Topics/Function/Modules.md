**Modules can be used to separate a code in separate files as per their functionality. This makes our code organized and easier to maintain**

* Module is a file that contains code to perform a specific task. A module may contain variable, functions and classes, etc..

##### Example 1:
```
def add(a, b):
   result = a + b
   return result
```
* here we have defined a function `add` inside a module. the function takes in two numbers and return their sum.

#### Import modules in python:
* We use `import` keyword to import one module to another file.

`import example(file name)`

* Import only imports the module name then we need to use function name to use function 

`addition.add`
