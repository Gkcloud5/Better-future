#### Zombie state:

* When a process is created in UNIX using `fork()` system call. the parent process is cloned. if the parent process calls wait() system call, then the parent process is suspended until the child is terminated.
* At the termination of the child, a 'SIGCHILD' signal is generated by the kernel which is delivered to the parent.
