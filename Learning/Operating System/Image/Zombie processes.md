#### Zombie Process:

* A process which has finished the execution but still has entry in the process table to report to its parent process is known as a zombie process.
*  A child process always first becomes a zombie before being removed from the process table.
* The parent process reads the exit status of the child process which reaps off the child process entry from the process table.
* 


#### Zombie state:

* When a process is created in UNIX using `fork()` system call. the parent process is cloned. if the parent process calls wait() system call, then the parent process is suspended until the child is terminated.
* At the termination of the child, a 'SIGCHLD' signal is generated by the kernel which is delivered to the parent.
* Parent on receipt of 'SIGCHLD' reads the status of the child from the process table.
