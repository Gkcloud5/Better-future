#### About it:

* Deadlock detection and recovery is the process of identifying and resolving deadlocks in a OS.
* Two main approaches
	*  **Prevention:** This approach tries to prevent deadlocks from happening in the first place. Number of technique to prevent a deadlock
			   1. Resource allocation
			   2. Resource preemption
			   3. Priority inversion prevention	
	* **Detection and recovery:** This approach allows deadlocks to happen but it detects them and recovers from them ASAP.
		* Resource allocation graph
		* Wait for graph
		* Banker's algorithm

#### Difference between prevention and detection/recovery:

* Prevention aims to avoid deadlocks
* Detection and recovery aim to identify and resolve deadlocks that already occurred.

Deadlock detection and recovery is an important aspect of OS design and management, as it affects stability and performance of the system.
