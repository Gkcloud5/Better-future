**Once deadlock is detected we can use process termination method to recover a process from deadlock**

#### 2 Technique:

##### 1.  Abort all deadlock process:

* Out of 10 process 3 process are suffering with deadlock, so we need to eliminate the 3 process which are suffering from deadlock
* Disadvantage of this process is
	* In 3 process if they are completed almost 80 to 90% after that they suffering from deadlock, inorder to use this method they will kill 3 process so till now this process takes so much CPU time and some other resources time to complete 80%, all will be waste.

##### 2. Abort 1 process at a time until deadlock is eliminated:

* out of 10 process only 3 process
