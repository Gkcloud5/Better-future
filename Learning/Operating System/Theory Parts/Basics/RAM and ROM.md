#### RAM:

* Random Access memory is used to temporarily store data that the computer is currently using or processing. 
* RAM is volatile memory
	* which means that the data stored in it is lost when the power is turned OFF
* RAM typically stored
	* OS
	* Application program
	* Data that computer currently using


#### ROM:

* Read only memory used to store data permanently.
* ROM is non-volatile memory
* ROM typically stored
	* BIOS
		* Which contains the instruction for booting the computer as well as firmware for other hardware devices


#### Types of Memory:

#### Some info about RAM:

* It also called `read-write memory` or *main memory*  or the *primary memory*
* Programs and the data that the CPU requires during the execution of a program are stored in this memory.
* It is a volatile memory.

##### Types of RAM

* Static RAM
* Dynamic RAM

**Static RAM:** Static read only memory, it is a type of semiconductor which is widely used in computing devices and microprocessors.

**Dynamic RAM:** Dynamic read only memory. it is made of capacitors and has smaller data life span than static RAM.

#### ROM:

* It stores crucial information essential to operate the system, like the program essential to boot the computer
* It is non-volatile

##### Types of ROM:

* PROM
* EPROM
* EEPROM
* MROM

**PROM:**
* [Prom](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prom-full-form/)
* Programmable read-only memory
* It can be programmed by the user. once programmed, the data and instructions in it cannot be changed
