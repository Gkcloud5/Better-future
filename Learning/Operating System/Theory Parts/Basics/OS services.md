##### Error Detection:

* OS responsibility to detect any error in hardware or software device.
* If it find any error then need to take appropriate reaction.

##### Resource allocation:

* We have several resources like main memory, secondary memory, IO devices and CPU.
* OS responsibility is need to assign resource as per program requirement

##### Accounting:

* let consider we have a computer network, Accounting will help to calculate which person use which resources and how much time he need a resource.
