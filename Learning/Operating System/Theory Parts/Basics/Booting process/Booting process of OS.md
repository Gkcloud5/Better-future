#### What Happens when we turn on computer:

* The power supply sends electricity to the components of the computer, such as the motherboard, hard drive and fans
* The BIOS(**Basic input and output system**) initializes and performs a **Power-on-self-test**(POST) which checks the basic hardware components to ensure they are working properly. if any issue are detected,  error messages may be displayed.
* OS, such as windows OS or macOS, is loaded from the hard drive or another storage device into the computer RAM.
* OS then initializes it's own components and drivers and presents the login screen or desktop environment to the user
