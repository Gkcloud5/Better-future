#### About it:

* **Main memory is a volatile memory.**
	* Volatile means content in main memory will be deleted when we turned off a system
* Hard disk is perfect example for secondary memory.


#### Secondary memory allocation approach:

* ##### [[Contiguous allocation]]
* ##### [[Linked list allocation]]
* ##### [[Indexed allocation]]
