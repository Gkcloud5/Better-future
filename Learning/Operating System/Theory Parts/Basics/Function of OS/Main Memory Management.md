#### About main memory management:

* CPU only access a main memory.
* During execution OS loads program from hard disk to main memory
* Once all the operations are over then OS deallocate a memory from main memory
* Once the execution is over then OS transfer a data from main memory to secondary memory.


#### OS approach for memory allocation:

2 Approach
 * [[Contiguous memory allocation]] 
	 * MFT -- Multiprogramming with fixed tasks
	 * MVT -- Multiprogramming with variable tasks
* [[Non-continuous memory]]
	* Paging
	* Segmentation
