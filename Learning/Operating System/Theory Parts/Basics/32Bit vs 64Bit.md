[32 vs 64](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-32-bit-64-bit-operating-systems/)


* In computing, two types of processor existing
	* 32 bit
	* 64 Bit

* These type of processors tell us how much memory a processor can access from a CPU register.

* 32-Bit system can access 2^32 different memory address. it can access 4GB RAM ideally

* 64-Bit system can access 2^64 different memory address. 16 EB of memory. important point is it is access more than 4GB ram without any issue, if a computer has 8GB ram, it is better has a 64-bit processor.

* Major diff between 32 bit and 64 bit is **number of calculation per second they can perform**
	* 64bit comes with dual-core, quad core, six core and eight core versions for home computing.
	* Multiple cores allow for an increased number of calculations per second that can be performed.
