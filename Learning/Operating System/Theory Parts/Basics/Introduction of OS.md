#### About OS:

* An OS acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware.
* Purpose of OS is an to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently.
* An OS is software that manages computer hardware.

#### Definition of OS:

* An OS is a program that controls the execution of application programs and acts as an interface between the user of a computer and the computer hardware.
* A more common definition is that the OS is the one program running at all times on the computer(Usually called the kernel). 
* An OS is concerned with the allocation of resources  and services, such as
	* Memory
	* Processors
	* Devices
	* Information


#### Features of OS:

* An OS makes a computer more **convenient** to use.
* An OS allows the computer system resources to be used **efficiently**
* OS give maximum **Throughput** (No.of tasks per unit time)


#### Functions of OS:

* **Resources Management:
	* OS need to allocate a resources as per the process and need to decide how long it want to there in CPU 
* **Process Management:**
	* OS do scheduling a process and terminate a process.
* **Storage Management**
	* File system mechanism used for the management of the storage.
* **Memory Management**
	* OS need to decide how much memory has been used and by whom. it has to decide which process needs memory space and how much.
	* OS has to allocate and deallocate the memory space.
* **Security/Privacy Management**
	* Privacy also provided by the OS


#### Working skeleton of OS:

User --> System and application program --> OS --> Hardware

* Hardware consists of memory, CPU, ALU, I/O devices, peripheral devices and storage devices.
