[Character of OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functions-of-operating-system/)

#### Characteristics:

##### Virtualization:

* OS provide virtualization capabilities, allowing multiple OS or instance of an OS to run on a single physical machine.
* This can improve resource utilization and provide isolation between different OS or application.

##### Networking:

* OS provide networking capabilities, allowing the computer system connect to other system and devices over a network.
* Some feature are
	* Network protocols
	* Network security
	* Network interface

##### Scheduling:

* OS provide scheduling algorithms that determine the order in which tasks are executed on the system.
* These algorithms prioritize tasks based on their resource requirements and other factors to optimize system performance.

##### Interprocess communication:

* OS provide mechanism for application to communicate with each other process, allowing them to share data and coordinate their activities.

##### Performance Monitoring:

* OS provides tools for monitoring system performance
	* CPU usage
	* memory usage
	* disk usage
	* network activity
* This can help identify performance bottlenecks and optimize system performance.


##### Backup and recovery:

* OS provide backup and recovery mechanism to protect data in the event of system failure or data loss.

##### Debugging:

* OS provide debugging tool that allow developers to identify and fix software bugs and other issue in the system.
