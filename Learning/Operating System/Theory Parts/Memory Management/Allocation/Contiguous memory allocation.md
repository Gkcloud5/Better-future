* It is also called as **fixed partitioning**
* Here main memory is divided into partitions of equal or different sizes.
* The OS always resides in first partition while the other partitions can be used to store a user processes.
* In fixed partitioning,
	* the partitions cannot overlap
	* A process must be contiguously present in a partition for the execution.

* 2 Approach
	* [[Multi programming with fixed size partition]]
	* [[Multi programming with variable size partition]]
