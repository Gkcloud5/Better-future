#### About segmentation:

* It is mainly used to maintain modular structure of program.
* It's used to divide physical memory into logical segments.
	* Each segment can be used by a different process or thread.
	* Each segment can have its own permission.
* This allows the OS to protect different parts of memory from each other.
* And to prevent one process from accidentally or maliciously overwriting process's memory.
