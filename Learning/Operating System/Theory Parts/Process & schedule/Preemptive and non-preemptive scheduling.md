#### Preemptive scheduling:

##### What is preemptive scheduling:

* In preemptive scheduling algorithm used in OS where a running process can be interrupted and suspended by then OS to allow other high-priority processes to execute.
* It is designed to provide better responsiveness and fairness to different processes running in the system.
* One of the main reason for using preemptive scheduling is to ensure that high priority processes are executed in a timely manner.
* It is used when a process switches from running state to ready state or from the waiting state to ready state. the resources are allocated to the process for a limited amount of time and then taken away, and the process is again placed back in the ready queue.
