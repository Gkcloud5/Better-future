#### What is MLQ scheduling:

* Here one ready queue process are divided to multiple ready queue.
* For example, a ready queue converted to 4 parts
	* System process --> OS related process
	* Foreground process --> Process response time is very very less
	* Background process --> 
	* System process
* Based on process characteristic, it will assign as per the queue
