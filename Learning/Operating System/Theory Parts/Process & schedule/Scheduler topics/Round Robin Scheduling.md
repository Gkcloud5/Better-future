#### What is round robin algorithm and why we need it?

* It is popular scheduling algorithm used in OS to allocate CPU time to multiple processes.
* It provides a fair and balanced approach by allowing each process to run for a fixed time slice, and then moving to the next process in the queue.
* It's main goal is to achieve responsiveness and prevent any single process from monopolizing the CPU for an extended period.
* It is commonly used in time-sharing systems or environments where multiple users or processes complete for CPU resources
