#### What is non-preemptive priority scheduling?

* It is same as priority scheduling without preemption, is a scheduling algorithm in which a running process continues to execute until it completes, blocks for IO. once a process is allocated the CPU, it retains control until it finishes.
* It is non-preemptive so once process allocated in CPU then any other process won't execute until currently running process completed
