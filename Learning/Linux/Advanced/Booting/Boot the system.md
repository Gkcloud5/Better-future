* Linux boot process can be broken down in 4 simple stages:
	* BIOS
	* Bootloader
	* Kernel
	* Init

#### BIOS:

* BIOS --> Basic input and output system
* It initialize the hardware and makes sure with a Power-on-self test(POST) that all the hardware is good to go.
* The main job of the BIOS is to load up the bootloader
