#### Explanation about it:

* OSPF protocol is one of family of IP routing protocols.
* It is used to find the best path between source and the destination router using its own shortest path first.
* The protocol which aims at moving the packet within a large autonomous system or routing domain.
* It is a network layer protocols.
* OSPF is one of the intradomain protocols.
	* Intradomain protocol means that his protocol is used within the network or an area.
* OSPF protocol is the protocol that works based on the link [[State routing algorithm]] in which each router has the information about each domain and uses this information to determine the shortest path.
