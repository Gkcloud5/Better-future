--------------------------------------

#### Explanation about it:

* It is a type of routing algorithm used in computer networks to determine the best path for data packets to travel from source to destination.
* It's operates based on the exchange of information among network nodes. 
	* Each node gathers information about the state of its directly connected links and shares this information with other nodes in the network.

### Working overview:

##### Discovery:
* Each node in the network initially discovers its neighboring nodes and determines the cost associated with each link.
	* This information is typically obtained through a process called link state advertisement exchange.

##### Building a link state database:
* Each node collects the LSAs received from neighboring nodes and builds a comprehensive database that represents the current state of network.
* This database includes information about the nodes, links and their associated costs.

##### Computing the shortest path:
* Using the link state database, each node independently calculates the shortest path to every other node in the network.
* The shortest path calculation takes into account the link costs and uses a metric, such as the total cost or hop count, to determine the optimal route.

##### Generating the routing table:
* Once the shortest path to all nodes in the network is determined, each node constructs its own routing table based on this information.
	* Routing table contains entries specifying the next hop and outgoing interface for each destination in the network.

##### Updating and propagating information:
* As the network state changes, nodes update their link-state databases accordingly.
	* They then recalculated the shortest paths and update their routing tables.
	* These updates are propagated to neighboring nodes using LSA exchanges, ensuring that all nodes have an up to date view of the network.

##### Forwarding packets:
* When a node receives a data packet destined for a specific destination, it consults its routing table to determine the next hop and outgoing interface.
* The packet is then forwarded to the next node along the calculated path, eventually reaching its destination.


**By using the link state routing algorithm, networks can dynamically adapt to changes in the network topology, provide fault tolerance and optimize the path selection based on various metrics.**
