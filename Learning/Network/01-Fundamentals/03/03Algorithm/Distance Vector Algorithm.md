--------------------------------------

#### Explanation about it:

* Distance vector is the "Dynamic routing" protocol.

### What is DVR?

* Basically it used to calculate path.
* A distance vector protocol calculates the distance and direction of the vector of the next hop from the information obtained by the neighboring router.

### Key points:

##### Network information:
* Every node in the network should have information about its neighboring node.
* Each node in the network is designed to share information with all nodes in the network.

##### Routing pattern:
* In DVR the data shared by the nodes are transmitted only to that node that is linked directly to one or more nodes in the network.

##### Data sharing:
* The nodes share the information with the neighboring node from time to time as there is a change in network topology.
