--------------------------------------

### Explanation about it:

* A computer network comprises two or more computers that are connected
	* either by cable(wired) or wifi(wireless)
		* with the purpose of transmitting, exchanging or sharing data and resources.
* We can build computer network using 
	* Hardware(routers, switches, access points and cables)
	* Software(OS or business applications)
* Computer network enable communication for every business, entertainment and research purpose. the internet, online search, audio and video.
* Building blocks of a computer network are `Nodes` and `Links`.
	* A network `node` can be illustrated as equipment for data communication like
		* Modem, router, etc
	* `Link` in computer networks can be defined as wires or cables or wireless network.
* The aim of the computer network is sharing of resources among various devices

### How does computer network work?

* [[Nodes in networking|Nodes]] and [[Links in network |Links]] are basic building blocks in computer networking. 
* In a working computer network, nodes follow a set of rules or protocols that define how to send and receive electronic data via the links.
* [[Computer network architecture]] defines the design of these physical and logical components.

### Purpose of computer network:

* Exchange data and share resources with each other.
* They were initially used to transmit data over telephone lines and had limited commercial and scientific applications.
* Modern-day network solutions deliver more than connectivity. they are critical for the digital transformation and success of businesses today.
* Modern computer networks can:
	* ##### Operate virtually:
		* The underlying physical network infrastructure can be logically partitioned to create multiple "overlay" networks. in an overlay computer network.
		* Nodes are virtually linked and data can be transmitted between them through multiple physical paths.
	* ##### Integrate on a large scale:
		* Modern networking services connect physically distributed computer networks.
		* These services can optimize network functions through automation and monitoring to create one large-scale, high performance network.
		* Network services can be scaled up or down based on demand.
	* ##### Respond quickly to changing conditions:
		* Many computer networks are software-defined.
		* Traffic can be routed and controlled centrally using a digital interface.
		* These computer networks support virtual traffic management.
	* ##### Provide data security:
		* All networking solutions come with in-built security features like encryption and access control.


### What is network topology?

	The arrangement of nodes and links is called network topology. they can be configured in different ways to get different outcomes. some types of network topologies are

##### Bus topology:
* Each node is linked to one other node only.
* Date transmission over the network connections occurs in one direction.
* Here every computer and network device is connected to a single cable.
* It is bi-directional
	* Communication typically occurs in one direction, from one end of the bus to the other.
* It is a multi point connection and a non-robust topology because if the backbone fails the topology crashes.

##### Ring Topology:
* Each node is linked to two other nodes, forming a ring.
* Data can flow bi-directionally.
* However, single node failure can bring down the entire network.

##### Star topology:
* A central server node is linked to multiple client network devices. this topology performs better as data does not have to go through each node.
* It is also more reliable

##### Mesh topology:
* Every node is connected to many other nodes.
* In a full mesh topology, every node is connected to every other node in the network.
