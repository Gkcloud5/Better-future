### What is web application security?

* Web application security is the practice of protecting websites, applications and API's from attacks.
* It's ultimate aims are keeping web applications functioning smoothly and protecting business from cyber vandalism, data theft, unethical competition and other negative consequences.


### What are common web application security risks?

* Web applications may face a number of attack types depending on the attacker's goals, the nature of the targeted organization's work, and the application's particular security gaps.
* Common attack types include:

##### Zero day vulnerabilities:

* These are vulnerabilities unknow to an application's makers, and which thus do not have a fix available, we now see more than 20K every year.
* Attacks look to exploit these vulnerabilities quickly, and often follow up by seeking to evade protections put in place by security vendors.

##### Cross site scripting:

* XSS is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject client-side scripts into a webpage in order to access important information directly, impersonate the user, or trick the user into revealing important information.

##### SQL injection:

* It is a method by which an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the way a database executes search queries. attackers use SQi to gain access to unauthorized information.
