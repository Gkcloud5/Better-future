--------------------------------------

### What it is:

* In networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message
* Data sent over computer networks such as the internet, is divided into packets.
	* These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them.

### Why use packets?

* Without doing packets we can transfer data between devices but there is some limitations like
	* We can transfer data between two devices without any issue if one more device came to network then it will be little hard
		* So on that time packet will play major role.
* Internet is [[Packet Switching]] network.

### What is packet loss?

* **What is hop count?**[](https://hopzero.com/what-does-hop-count-mean/)
	* Hop counter refers to the number of devices, usually routers, that a piece of data travels through.
	* Each time that a packet of data moves from one router to another
