### What it is:

* But it also means different paths of transmission and out-of-order delivery are possible, depending on the fluctuating loads on the network's nodes at the moment.
* This kind of packet switching is sometimes called `datagram` switching.
* Each packet in connection less packet switching includes
	* Source address
	* Destination address
	* Total number of packets
	* Sequence number for reassembly.
