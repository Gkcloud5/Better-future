### What it is:

* In this type of architecture nodes may be servers or clients.
* Server nodes provides resources like memory, processing power or data to client nodes.
* Server nodes may also manage client node behavior. clients may communicate with each other, but they do not share resources.
* In a client server architecture, there are two main types of computers
	* Clients
	* Servers
* **Clients:**
	* Clients are the computers that request services from the server.
	* They typically have less powerful hardware and software than servers.
* **Servers:**
	* Servers are the computers that provides services to the clients. 
	* they typically have more powerful hardware and software and are dedicated to providing services to the hardware and software and are dedicated to providing services to the network.

### Example:

* **Web Browsing:** When you visit a website, your computer requests a web page from the web server. the web server then sends the web page to your computer.

### How it works:

1. **Clients sends a request:**
	1. The clients devices sends a request for a particular service or resource to the server. the request could be for accessing a web page, retrieving a file, submitting data or performing a specific action.
2. **Server processes the request:**
	1. Upon receiving the client's request, the server processes it by executing the required actions or retrieving the requested data.
3. **Server sends a response:**
	1. Once the server has processed the request, it generates a response containing the requested information or the result of the requested action.
	2. The response is then sent back to the client device over the network.
4. **Client receives the response:**
	1. The client device receives the response from the server and processes it accordingly.
	2. It may display the requested information, utilize the received data, or take further action based on the server's response.
