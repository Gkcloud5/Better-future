--------------------------------------

### What it is:

* IP stands for **Internet protocol** and v4 stands for **version 4.**
* It is are **32-bit** integers which will be expressed in decimal notation.

### Parts of IPv4:

##### Network part:
* The network part indicates the distinctive variety that's appointed to the network.
* The network part conjointly identifies the category of the network that's assigned.

##### Host part:
* The host part uniquely identifies the machine on your network. this part of the IPv4 address is assigned to every host.
* For each host on the network, the network part is the same, however, the host half must vary.

##### Subnet number:
* This is the nonobligatory part of the IPv4.
* Local networks that have massive numbers of hosts are divided into subnets and subnet numbers are appointed to that.


### Characteristics of IPv4:

* IPv4 could be a 32-bit IP address.
* IPv4 could be a numeric address, and its bits are separated by a dot.
* It has
	* [[Unicast in networking]]
	* [[Broadcast in networking]]
	* [[Multicast in networking]]
* IPv4 supports [[Virtual length subnet mask|VLSM]]
* It uses the [[Post address resolution protocol]] to map to the MAC address.
* [[RIP in network|RIP]] may be a routing protocol supported by the routed daemon.
* Networks ought to be designed either manually or [[DHCP]].

### Limitation of IPv4:
