### Explanation about it:

#### What is an internet exchange point?

* IXP is a physical location through which internet infrastructure companies such as ISP and CDN's connect with each other.
* This location exist on the "edge" of different networks.
* By having a presence inside of an IXP location, companies are able to shorten their path to transit coming from other participating networks
	* Thereby reducing latency, improving round-trip time and reduce cost also.
* IXP is a physical location where multiple ISP, content providers and other network operators come together to exchange internet traffic between their networks.
* Main purpose of IXP is to vacillate the direct exchange of data traffic instead of routing it though 3rd party networks.
	* It will improve efficiency, speed and cost effectiveness

#### How does an IXP work?

* An IXP is essentially one or more physical locations containing network switches that route traffic between the different members networks
* IXP are large layer 2 LAN's that are built with one or many ethernet switches interconnected together across one or more physical buildings.
