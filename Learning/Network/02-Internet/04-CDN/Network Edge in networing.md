### Explanation about it:

### What is Edge Computing?

* Edge computing is a network philosophy focused on bringing computing as close to the source of data as possible in order to reduce latency and bandwidth use.
* Bringing computation to the network's edge minimizes the amount of long-distance communication that has to happen between a client and server.

### What is the network edge?

* Edge of the network is geographically close to the device.


### Difference between edge computing from other computing models?

* In old modules, application ran and data was stored locally on a user's device, or sometimes within an on premise data center.
* Cloud computing, cloud services are centralized in a vendor managed cloud, and can be accessed from any device over the internet.
* Cloud computing can introduce latency, because of the distance between users and data centers where cloud services are hosted.
	* Edge computing moves computing closed to end users to minimize the distance that data has to travel
