### What is the difference between a switch and a router?

* Routers are necessary for an internet connection
	* Routers select paths for data packets to cross networks and reach their destinations.
* Switches are only used for interconnecting devices.
	* Homes and small offices need routers for internet access.

### What is a layer 2 switch? what is layer 3 switch?

*  Network switches can operate at either OSI layer 2 or layer 3.
* Layer 2 switches forwarded data based on the destination MAC address, while layer 3 switches forward data based on the destination IP address. 
	* Some switches can do both.

### What is an unmanaged switch? what is a managed switch?

* An unmanaged switch simply creates more ethernet ports on a LAN.
	* So that more local devices can access the internet.
	* Unmanaged switches pass data back and forth based on device MAC addresses.
* Managed switch fulfills the same function for much larger networks, and offers network administrators much
