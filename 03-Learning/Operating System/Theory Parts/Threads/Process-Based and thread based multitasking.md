* Multi tasking OS that gives you the perception of two or more tasks/jobs/processes running simultaneously.
* It does this by dividing system resources amongst these tasks/jobs/processes and switching between the tasks/jobs/processes while they are executing over and over again.
* CPU processes only one task at a time, but in multitasking the switching is so fast that it looks like the CPU is executing multiple processes simultaneously.
