#### About it:

* Both are used to manage and access memory.

##### Logical address:

* it is known as virtual address, is an address generated by CPU during program execution.
* The process access memory using logical address, which are translated by the OS into physical addresses

##### Physical address:

*  A physical address is the actual address in main memory where data is stored.
* It is used by **MMU**(Memory management unit) to translate logical addresses into physical address.
	* It keeps track of which logical addresses are currently in use by each process, and it translates those addresses into physical address so that the CPU can access the data.
