#### About secondary memory:

* Secondary storage, such as hard disk drives and solid state drives, is a non-volatile memory unit that has a larger storage capacity than main memory.
* It is used to store data and instructions that are not currently in use by the CPU.
* Secondary storage has the slowest access time and is typically the lease expensive type of memory in the memory hierarchy.
