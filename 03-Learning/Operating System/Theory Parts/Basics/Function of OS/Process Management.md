#### About Process Management:

* Process means program in execution. a program is collection of instruction that used to solve specific problem.
* Usually program stored in harddisk.
* While executing program OS transfer a program from hard disk to main memory.
* Reason for moving main memory is CPU only run a program if it's in main memory.

**Process Management activity:**

* Create a process
* Suspend a process
* Resume a process
* Handle interprocess communication
* Process synchronization
* Deadlock handle

**Process scheduling:**

* In multiprogramming system multiple process resides in main memory. out of all process which process we need to execute first that should decided upon process scheduling.
	* FCFS - First come first serve
	* SJF - shortest job first
	* SRTF - shortest remaining time first
	* Priority
	* Round robin
