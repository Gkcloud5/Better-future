--------------------------------------

#### Explanation about it:

* Network hosts have a unique address they can be found at. these address are known as IP addresses

```
204.23.124.23
```

* Address actually contains two parts
	* Network portion
	* Host portion
* IP address is separated into octets by the periods. so there are 4 octets in an IPv4 address.
* Octet is 8 bits and 8 bits actually equal 1 byte. so we also refer IPv4 address as having 4 bytes.
