--------------------------------------

#### Explanation about it:

* If we did not have a DNS then we need to access google.com via IP address, if we provide a domain name then it does not let us take to website.
* Low level networking only understands the raw IP address to identify a host.
* DNS allows us humans to keep track of websites and hosts by name instead of an IP address.
* DNS stands for domain name system, it's like a phone book for the internet.
* DNS works as a distributed network of servers worldwide, it translates domain names into IP addresses and allowing you to access websites on the internet by typing user-friendly names into your browsers.
