**Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks, allowing us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save some time.**

```
block_head:
    1st block line
    2nd block line
    ...
```

##### Example:

```
def my_function():
    print("Gk is hope")

my_function()
```


##### Passing arguments in function:
```
def func(name,age):
    print("my name is %s" %(name))
    print("My age is %d" %(age))

func(gokul,26)
```
