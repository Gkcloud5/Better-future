#### About Memory allocation:

* Allocating memory for a process.
* It is critical function of the OS, as it ensures that each process has access to the memory it needs to run.
* Also, preventing processes from accessing each other's memory.

#### Why OS need memory allocation?

* ##### Efficient resource utilization:
	* Memory allocation allows the OS to efficiently allocate and manage the limited physical memory resource among multiple programs.
	* the OS ensures that memory is used optimally.
* ##### Process isolation:
	* Memory allocation helps in providing isolation between different processes running on the computer.
	* Each process has its own allocated memory space, preventing interference and unauthorized access to other processes memory
* ##### Memory Protection:
	* Memory allocation allows the OS to enforce memory protection mechanisms. 
	* OS ensures that each process can only access its allocated memory and prevents unauthorized access to memory areas belonging to other processes or the OS itself.
* ##### Virtual Memory Management:
	* Memory allocation plays a crucial role in virtual memory systems.
	* It enables efficient swapping of data between physical memory and disk storage
