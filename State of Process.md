#### 2.Ready:

* Here process is ready for execution, it is waiting for CPU to execute a program.

#### 3. Scheduler:

* It allocate process from ready to CPU that means change process state to running.

#### 4. Running:

* It means CPU executing a process, if one process is executing in CPU then that process status will be running state.

#### 5. Interrupt:
