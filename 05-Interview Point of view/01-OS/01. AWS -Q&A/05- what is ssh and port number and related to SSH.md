#### What is SSH?

* SSH means Secure Shell
* It is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely access and manage remote computers over a potentially unsecured network(internet).
	* [Cryptographic Protocols](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/library/what-are-cryptographic-protocols) provide secure connections, enabling two parties to communicate with privacy and data integrity.
* It provides a secure way to establish a secure communication channel between a client and server.
	* Allowing for secure remote access and data transfer

##### Key Components of SSH:
###### 1. Client and server:
	* Client initiates a connection to the server using SSH.
	* The server responds and establishes a secure communication channel.
###### 2. Cryptography:
	* SSH used encryption and cryptographic techniques to secure data being tranmitted over the network.
	* Preventing unauthorized access.
###### 3. Authentication:
	* SSH requires authentication before allowing access to the server.
	* This is commonly done using password or public key authentication.
###### 4. Port Number:
	* By default port number is 22 for communication.
