	* Regularly update the web server software, Plugins, libraries and other software components.
	* Out dated software can have vulnerabilities that hackers can exploits
* ##### Strong Authentication:
	* Strong passwords for all user accounts 
	* Implement multi-factor authentication(MFA) wherever possible.
		* This adds extra layer security 
* ##### Firewall:
	* Setup firewall to filter incoming and outgoing traffic.

	* Limit who has access to the server.
	* Disable unnecessary accounts.
* ##### File Permissions:
	* Set appropriate file and directory permission to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive files.
* ##### Security Headers:
	* Implement security headers in web server configuration to provide additional layer of security
		* Content Security Policy
		* HTTP strict transport security
* ##### Secure Coding Practices:
	* Avoid common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection
	* Cross site scripting
* ##### DDoS protection:
	* Consider **Distributed Denial of service** protection services to mitigate the impact of DDoS attacks that could overwhelm your server.
