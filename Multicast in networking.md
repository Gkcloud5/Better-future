### What it is:

* One to Many
* When the data is transmitted from a single source host to a specific group of hosts having the interest to receive the data, it is known as multicast transmission.

* Multicast refers to a communication mechanism in which data packets are sent from a source device to a group of destination devices that have expressed interest in receiving the data.
* Here single sender can transmit data to multiple recipients simultaneously.
* In a multicast transmission, a single packet is addressed to a group of devices, rather than to a single device like in unicast.
	* The packet is then replicated and sent to all devices in the group, which allows for more efficient use of network resources.
