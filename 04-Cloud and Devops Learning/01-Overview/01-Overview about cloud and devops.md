--------------------------------------

#### Explanation about it:

`Cloud and devops are related but not same`

##### 1.1 About Devops:

```
Devops = Development + Operations
```

* Devops is a philosophy that promotes better communication and collaboration between team and other's in organization

##### 1.1.1 Devops Environment:

* ###### CI/CD:
	* **CI:**
		* Test code and add to large codebase
	* **CD(Continues Delivery):**
		* Build -> Test -> Deploy
	* **CD(Continues Deployment):**
		* Every code change automatically run through pipeline and works automatically.
* ###### System Tools:
	* Real-time monitoring
	* Incident Management
	* Configuration Management

##### 1.1.2 How devops works?

* Plan
* Code
* Build
* Test
* Release
* Deploy
* Operate
* Monitor

`Devops main goal is stramline the process of getting software from the prorgaming stage to the deployment stage`


##### 2.1 About Cloud:

* Cloud Administrator
	* Manage and cloud based role
	* Container based deployment platform
		* Docker
		* Kubernetes
	* Managed hosted data
	* Need to know about pricing
		* Should save cost
	* Infrastructure code
		* Provision cloud environment
			* Cloud formation
			* Ansible


**Devops and cloud administration are grounded in the use of automation and orchestration to get things done**


##### 2.3 Confusion to start which one first cloud or devops:

* ###### Mistakes to avoid
	* Reading Book
	* Try to learn more tools in short period
	* Buy costly course
* ###### Best way to learn [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRcgc0LvjFI)
	* **Learn tool bare minimum requirement to start a work**
		* Example: terraform
			* What is terraform
			* Why it's important and what problem it solved among others
			* How to install terraform
			* How to provision instance by using terraform
			* check job openings website and know which things are they asking related to learning topic
* Overview of Devops [](https://learn.cloudadvocate.net/courses/DevOps-Mastery-641eb17de4b01b8859faaf7d)
