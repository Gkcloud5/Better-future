--------------------------------------

#### Explanation about it:

`Cloud and devops are related but not same`

##### 1.1 About Devops:

```
Devops = Development + Operations
```

* Devops is a philosophy that promotes better communication and collaboration between team and other's in organization

##### 1.1.1 Devops Environment:

* ###### CI/CD:
	* **CI:**
		* Test code and add to large codebase
	* **CD(Continues Delivery):**
		* Build -> Test -> Deploy
	* **CD(Continues Deployment):**
		* Every code change automatically run through pipeline and works automatically.
* ###### System Tools:
	* Real-time monitoring
	* Incident Management
	* Configuration Management

##### 1.1.2 How devops works?

* Plan
* Code
* Build
* Test
* Release
* Deploy
* Operate
* Monitor

`Devops main goal is stramline the process of getting software from the prorgaming stage to the deployment stage`


##### 2.1 About Cloud:

* Cloud Administrator
	* Manage and cloud based role
	* Container based deployment platform
		* Docker
		* Kubernetes
	* Managed hosted data
	* Need to know about pricing
		* Should save cost
	* Infrastructure code
		* Provision cloud environment
			* Cloud formation
			* Ansible


**Devops and cloud administration are grounded in the use of automation and orchestration to get things done**


##### 2.3 Confusion to start which one first cloud or devops:

* ###### Mistakes to avoid
	* Reading Book
	* Try to learn more tools in short period
	* Buy costly course
* ###### Best way to learn [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRcgc0LvjFI)
	* **Learn tool bare minimum requirement to start a work**
		* Example: terraform
			* What is terraform
			* Why it's important and what problem it solved among others
			* How to install terraform
			* How to provision instance by using terraform
			* check job openings website and know which things are they asking related to learning topic
* Overview of Devops [](https://learn.cloudadvocate.net/courses/DevOps-Mastery-641eb17de4b01b8859faaf7d)

##### 2.4 Plan 1:

1. Getting things to know about devops
2. Cover Basics before the devops tools
	1. Linux
	2. Networking
3. CI
	1. GIT
	2. Building and testing code with jenkins
4. Provision and automation
	1. Configuration Management
