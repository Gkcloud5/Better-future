--------------------------------------

#### Explanation about it:

 * Continuous integration and continuous deployment are essential practices in modern software development.
 * It aim to improve code quality, increase development efficiency and deliver software faster and more reliably.
 * To implement CI/CD successfully, developers and teams on various tools that facilitate and automate the process.

##### Reason for CI/CD necessary:
* ###### Automation:
	* CI/CD tools automate the process of building, testing and deploying code.
	* Reducing manual errors and saving time
* ###### Consistency:
	* CI/CD tools enforce a consistent development and deployment process across the team.
* ###### Speed:
	* CI/CD tools accelerate the software development lifecycle by automating repetitive tasks.
	* Developer can focus more on writing code, while to tools handle the process of integration, testing and deployment.
* ###### Quality Assurance:
	* Tools can test various types of tests, such as
		* unit tests
		* integration tests
		* end-to-end tests
* ###### Isolation and versioning:
	* CI/CD tools help manage dependencies and ensure the environment remains consistent.
	* They create isolated build and test env
	* Preventing conflicts between different projects and versions
* ###### Scalability:
	* As projects and teams grow, managing CI/CD processes manually becomes increasingly challenging.
	* CI/CD tools are designed to handle the scaling needs of development teams, allowing them to handle larger codebases and increasing workloads effectively.
* ###### Traceability:
	* CI/CD tools provide logs and reports that offer visibility into the entire development process.
	* Developers can track changes, monitor test results.
* ###### Continuous feedback:
	* It enable quick feedback loops, notifying developers about build or test failures immediately.
* ###### Security:
	* Integrate security scans and code analysis tools.
	* Helping identify vulnerabilities and potential security risks early in the development process.
* ###### Deployment Flexibility:
	* CD tools provide various deployment strategies like
		* Blue-green deploy
		* Canary releases
		* Feature flags
