--------------------------------------

### Explanation about it:

* ##### Setup a Jenkins environment:
	* Setup own local Jenkins server
* ##### Learn Jenkins basics:
	* Familiarize with basic concepts
		* Jobs
		* Builds
		* Pipelines
		* Nodes 
		* Plugin
	* We can use official documents
* ##### Hands-on tutorials:
	* Create simple Jenkins Jobs and pipelines
	* Doing basic tasks like
		* Building sample project
		* Running tests
		* Deploying to local server
* ##### Build a continuous integration pipeline:
	* Create a pipeline that automatically
		* Builds
		* tests
		* deploys sample application from our version control
	* This will help to understand the flow of typical CI/CD process
* ##### Version Control Integration:
	* Integrate Jenkins with a version control system like Git.
	* Setup webhooks or triggers to automatically start jenkins whenever code is pushed or merged
* ##### Scripting with jenkinsfiles:
	* Learn how to use Jenkins pipeline DSL to script your entire build and deployment process.
* ##### Use Plugins:
	* Explore and use various Jenkins plugin to extend functionality of our pipeline.
	* Like static code analysis
		* Test coverage reporting
* ##### Multi-Branch Pipeline:
	* Set up pipelines that work with multiple branches in our version control system.
	* This will simulate real-world scenarios where you have different features or bug fixes
* ##### Parameterized builds:
	* Parameterized - அளவுருவாக்கப்பட்ட
	* Practice how to create parameterized builds that allow us to customize the behavior's of our pipeline based on user input.
* ##### Error Handling and notification:
	* Implement error handling mechanisms in our pipeline
	* Setup notification to receive alerts when build fails or encounter issue
* ##### Security and credentials:
	* Manage user access and permission.
	* How to securely manage credentials and secrets
* ##### Scaling and Distributed Builds:
	* Experiment with setting up Jenkins agents on different machines to distribute the load of our builds.
	* This is important for larger projects and faster build times.
* ##### Monitoring and Logging:
	* Explore Jenkins monitoring tools and logs to understand the health and performance of our Jenkins instance.
* ##### Real Projects:
	* Try setting up a complete CI/CD pipeline for it.
* ##### Troubleshooting:
	* Encountering and resolving issues.
	* Troubleshoot problems in Jenkins is a valuable skill.
* ##### Community Involvement:
	* Engage with the Jenkins community.
