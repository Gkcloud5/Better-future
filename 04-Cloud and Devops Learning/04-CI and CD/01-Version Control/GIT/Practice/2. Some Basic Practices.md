--------------------------------------

### Explanation about it:


### Basics:
#### 1. Git Commit:
 * Commit in git repo records a snapshot of all the files in directory.
 * Git also maintain a history of which commits were made when.
```
git commit
```

#### 2. Branching in Git:
 * Branch are mainly used to simply point a specific commit.
 * It's easier to logically divide up your work than have big branches
```
git branch **name** //Create a new branch
git checkout **newbranchname** //Move to new branch
git commit /save changes in new branch
```

#### 3. Branches and merging:
 * Here we are going to see combine two different branches together.
 * `git merge` --> Combine work
```
git checkout **branch name**
git merge main
```

```
git branch bugFix
git checkout bugFix
git commit
git checkout main
git commit
git merge bugFix
```

#### 4. Git Rebase:
 * Second way of combining work between branches is rebasing.
 * Adv of rebasing is that it can be used to make a nice linear sequence of commits.
	 * Commit log / history of the repository will be a lot cleaner if only rebasing is allowed.
* Branch join from bugFix to main
	* `git rebase main`
```
git branch bugFix
git checkout bugFix
git commit
git checkout main
git commit
git checkout bugFix
git rebase main
```


### Ramping Up in Git
* Here we are going to understand different ways to move through the commit tree that represents in our project.
#### 1. HEAD:
 * It is the symbolic name for the currently checked out commit.
	 * What commit 
 *  It always point to the most recent commit which reflected in working tree.
```
git checkout C1
git checkout main
git commit
git checkout C2
```

```
#Let's head from bugFix
```

#### 2. Relative Refs:
 * `git log` will help to see hashes.
 * With relative refs, you can edit specify commit
 * 2 Steps
	 * Moving upwards one commit at a time with `^`
	 * Moving upwards a number of times with `~<num>`
```
git checkout main^ //first parent

git checkout main^^ //2nd gen parent
```

```
git checkout bugFix
git checkout HEAD^
```

* `~` tilde operator - count of parent

* Branch forcing
* `git branch -f main HEAD~3`
```
//Move HEAD
//Move main
//Move bugFix

```
