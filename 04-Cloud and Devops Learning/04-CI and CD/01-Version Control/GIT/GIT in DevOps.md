### Overview of GIT:

##### 1. Repository(repo):
 * A repository is a storage location where all the versioned files and their history are stored.
 * It can be hosted remotely.
	 * GitHub
	 * GitLab
	 * BitBucket
* Or you can store locally

##### 2. Commits:
 * A commit represent a snapshot of the changes made to one or more files in the repository at a specific point  in time.
 * Each commit has a unique identifier(hash) and is associated with a commit message that describes the changes made.

##### 3. Branches:
 * Branches are used to work on new feature, bug fixes or experiments without affecting the main codebase
 * Default repo has a master/main branch.
 * Developers create a new branch and can merge them back into the main branch once the changes are tested and reviewed.

##### 4. Clone:
 * Cloning a repo means creating a local copy of the remote repo. this allows you to work on the code locally, make changes and then push those changes back to the remote repo.

##### 5. Pull/Push:
 * Pulling means fetching changes from the remote repo and merging them into your local branch.
 * Pushing means sending your local commits to the remote repo.

##### 6. Merge:
 * Merging combines changes from one branch into another.
 * When we merge branches, git tries to automatically reconcile the changes,
 * If there are conflicts, you will need to resolve them manually.

##### 7. Pull request:
 * Pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another.
 * If it's often used in collaborative projects, where contributors submit their changes for review before merging them into main branch.

##### 8. Staging area(index):
 *
