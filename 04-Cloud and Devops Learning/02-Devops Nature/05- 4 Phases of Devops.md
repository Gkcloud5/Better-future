	* Here, organizations standardized on the same set of tools, with one preferred tool for each stage of the DevOps lifecycle.
	* Here problem is when having software changes through the tools for each stage

	* It over comes above problem.
	* Organization adopted DIY DevOps.
	* Between their tools need to do lot custom work to integrate their DevOps point solutions together.
