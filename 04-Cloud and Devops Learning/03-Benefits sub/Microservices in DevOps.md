### Explanation about it:

#### What is microservices?
 * It is a architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over-well defined API's
 * It make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation.


#### Diff between monolithic and microservices

 * In monolithic architectures, all processes are tightly coupled and run as a single service.
	 * Any one service is spike then total app will be affected
	 * Adding and improving feature in monolithic is too difficult.
	 * Chances for failure is too high
* In microservices,
	* We can run each service as independent components.
	* This service will communicate with each other with a help of API
	* Very easy to add feature, update a code, deployed and scale a app.
