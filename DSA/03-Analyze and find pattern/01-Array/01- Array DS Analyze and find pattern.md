### What type of problem i get in array:

1. **Prefix Sum Array Problems:**
	1. Store value of prefix sum of elements up to that position
		1. [Sum1](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/)
		2. [[724. Find Pivot Index]]
```
Input: [10, 2, -2, -20, 10], target = -10
Output: 3 (subarrays with sum -10: [10, 2, -2], [2, -2, -20, 10], [-20, 10])

```

1. **Two Pointer Technique**:
	1. It used to solving problems like finding pairs with certain property
	2. Finding subarrays that satisfy a specific condition
	3. Sums solved
		1. [[2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array]]
```
Input: [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [2, 7] (indices 0 and 1)
```

1. **Sorting and Searching**:
	1. Sorting will help to solve many problems
	2. Searching will find elements that's in sorted array
	3. Sums solved
		1. [[1403. Minimum Subsequence in Non-Increasing Order]]
		2. [[2733. Neither Minimum nor Maximum]]
2. **Frequency Counting**:
	1. Counting occurrences of elements in the array or determining frequency of certain patterns within the array
```
Input: [4, 2, 8, 8, 4, 6, 8]
Output: 8 (appears 3 times)
```
